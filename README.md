# check_ioc
Check_ioc is a script to check for various, selectable indicators of compromise on Windows systems via PowerShell and Event Logs. It was primarily written to be run on a schedule from a monitoring engine such as Nagios, however, it may also be run from a command-line (for incident response), or even from another monitoring system. The script is heavily commented and very readable with numerous usage examples in the script itself.
